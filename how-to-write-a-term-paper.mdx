A term paper is one of the academic writings required to be accomplished during the course of study of a student. Term paper writing is basically to prepare you for the future in academic writing. To teach you how to source and gather information on the internet and how to digest the information obtained and put it down in your own words. There are a lot of tools that can help you put the information in your own words to avoid plagiarism (copying the author/s word for word), they are called paraphrasing tools and they are quillbot.com, SEO tool, WordAi, grammerly.com for grammatical errors, etc.


> Academic writing is not an informal form of writing; it's not for a personal use. It’s a graded form of writing. You write to be graded so you have to be careful, conscious and attentive.

There are many ways to source materials for term papers and they are: 


- google.scholar.com, 
- Sci hub, 
- Google, etc.

There are different kinds of materials to use as a source for writing which are:

- articles,
- journals, 
- books, e-books, 
- websites 

I would recommend the first three.

## The general structure of term paper
1. Cover Page
2. Title page
3. Dedication
4. Acknowledgment
5. Abstract (if required)
6. Table of Content
7. Content (in chapters)
    - Introduction
    - The Body (this encompasses the focus of the study)
    - Conclusion
    - Recommendation (if required)  
8. References


**COVER PAGE**

This page entails;

-   Course title

-   Course code

-   Assignment title/essay topic)

-   Student name

-   Student Reg number

-   Date

**TITLE PAGE**

This page is simply the title/topic of your term paper

**DEDICATION**

At the student's discretion. It could be dedicated to family or friends.

**ACKNOWLEDGMENT PAGE**

Here, it is crucial you acknowledge your teacher, lecturer, staff and any other person who might have in one or another other helped you in writing your work.

**ABSTRACT/SUMMARY**

An abstract suggests a summary of a research paper. The section should concretely summarize your research. Before proceeding to write your abstract a concrete understanding of the topic is very important.  You can start by first breaking the words into pieces, and understanding each of the words before bringing them together.

**Characteristics of a Good Abstract**

-   Solid introduction or topic sentence.

-   Objective, aim, or purpose of the research paper or assignment

-   The method states the procedures used in the conduct of the study.

-   Major findings of your research or the results.

-   Main conclusion.

**Note:** Abstract should be written last. After writing this section. Ask yourself, if this section was taken out of this paper to stand on its own, would it fully tell the reader what I have covered in my paper? You can practice this by taking the section off the paper. Then read it independently outside the entire paper. Please do not introduce a new idea in this section.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

This table directs the reader to the headings, subheadings, and pages. Here, having a good understanding of your topic is very crucial as sourcing and gathering the right materials. From the materials sourced you can get headings and subheadings related or relevant to your topic and add them to your table of contents as you're doing this be careful not to deviate from the topic given.

**CONTENT**

-   **INTRODUCTION**

    You can only introduce something you understand so understanding the topic given is crucial. The introduction entails the background of the study, the aim, and the general overview of the study.

-   **THE BODY**

    Put the purpose of the paper or report at the front of your mind. Therefore, all your paragraphs must support the assignment topic. In doing this, you should solidify the background information (which must have been provided in the introduction section), dig into details, and provide contrasting viewpoints with academic evidence.

-   **CONCLUSIONS**

    The conclusion should summarize the research's key points.

    Note: Do not introduce new ideas.

-   **RECOMMENDATION**

    This section should aim at solving problems. It must connect to the assignment/report topic of your essay.

**REFERENCES**

This section is also known as Bibliography. It is an embodiment of all sources cited or employed in your essay. There are different types of referencing styles, they are:

-   The Modern Language Association (MLA) referencing style

-   The American Psychological Association (APA) referencing style

-   The Havard referencing style

-   The Chicago referencing style

In an instance where there are 10 (ten) citations i.e., in the text (in-text citation), in your term paper, there must be a list of these 10 (ten) sources of references in this references section. The referenced sources must be traceable and verifiable and recent, within the range of 10 years or less; I would recommend using 2014 - 2022.
